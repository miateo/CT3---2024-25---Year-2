With "Internet" we refer to a global system of interconnected computer networks, that are nodes(hosts) that share resources(data).
Hosts communicate with each other though _Internet Protocols_ that are set of rules to exchange information over a network; each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it and the layer at the lowest level controls the hardware.
> The most common protocol is the TCP/IP and it specifies how data should be _packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and recived_.![[Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 15.48.35.png]]

## World Wide Web
The WWW is an information system where each resource is identified by a **Uniform Resource Locators (URL)**, these resources can be accessed tough internet and web agent such as web browsers.

## Evolution of the web
- 1990: HTTP is defined
	It's a request-response protocol designed to exchange resources. It specify the fundamental concept of resource uniquely identified by a URL
- 1990: HTML is invented
	A declarative language that only allow to define the document structure
- 1993: MOSAIC is released
	The first web browser that allows the visualization of text and images on the same page
- 1995: Javascript is introduced
	A new language that allow a web page to dynamically modify it's own content
- 1996: CSS
	A language that is used to define how to visualize elements defined by markup language
- 1996 - 2000: Born the role of front-end developer
- 2000s: many front-end & back-end frameworks started to merge
	This trend towards abstraction led the creation of the concept of **Full-stack developer** -> _Simultaneous development of front-end and back-end_
- 2005: Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript And XML)
	Term that describes a set of technologies to develop web application that communicate _asynchronously_ with the server without interfering with the displayed page.
	
	> Ajax allows to push the application logic from the server to the clients thus reducing server load and costs ![[Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 16.11.33.png]]
	
- 2008: Google publishes Chrome
	The first web browser that's highly complient to web standards(ACID tests), it's secure and integrated with google services; it implements _Javascript Engine V8_: JIT compiler, optimized at runtime & inline caching

### WEB 1.0, 2.0 & 3.0
**WEB 1.0**:
- Static pages
- Content generated by few publishers and viewed by many users
**WEB 2.0**:
- Dynamic pages
- Content generated by users for users in communities
- Social Media
**WEB 3.0**: _Semantic Web_
- Content organized to be understood by both humans and machines
- Still not a standard at this point
