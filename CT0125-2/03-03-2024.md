# Authentication
Authentication means: **showing some evidence of the actual physical identity of a particular client** this is done through information shared between client and server.

> [!NOTE] Cookies
> A "cookie" identifies a user through a (Browser,Computer,Account) tuple. This can cause inconsistencies on multiple devices

HTTPS Supports two methods of authentication:
- Basic access authentication
- Digest Authentication

The client username:password response is encoded as a string through ` <crd> = base64(<username>:<password>)` this is done to protect eventual https injections.

Making the HTTPS protocol stateful increases the load on the server and this can create memory errors and overload on the server resources

### Tokens
Tokens are an effective way to implement client-side sessions:
a token is generated by the server on authentication and contains a signature to guarantees that if the token is modified than the token is not valid anymore.
